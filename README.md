WARNING!

I am moving off GitHub. This repo is now hosted [here](https://tangled.sh/did:plc:ab5inzxnpw4j2zvzlxupr5ut/bpavuk.term)

### bpavuk's Dotfiles!

To install these dotfiles, clone this repository (preferably into
`~/.dotfiles`), install GNU Stow, then type `stow <program-name>`. For Neovim,
that would be `stow nvim`. Make sure to read relevant READMEs inside every
dotfile directory to get a list of dependencies you need to install to make
this work!
